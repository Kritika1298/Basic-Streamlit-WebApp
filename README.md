# Python Web App for data Classification

A basic Web App built using Streamline Python for Classification of data by varying parameters.

## How to run it
The demo requires Python 3.6 or 3.7 (The version of TensorFlow we specify in requirements.txt is not supported in Python 3.8+). We suggest creating a new virtual environment, then running:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kritika1298/Basic-Streamlit-WebApp

cd Basic-Streamlit-WebApp

pip install -r requirement.txt

streamlit run main.py
```
